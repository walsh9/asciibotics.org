The absent-minded creator of this robot made it as a sort of tribute to the memory his lost daughter who disappeared when he was on an extended vacation to Europa. Only later did he realize that he did not actually bring her with him, but left her with his neighbors on Earth. He sold the designs to a Europan colleague and disclaimed all invetorship because he was so embarrassed. He then hurried home at once.
